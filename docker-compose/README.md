# Steps to Deploy:
1. **Install Docker Compose:**  
   Follow the [official Docker Compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

2. **Deploy Node:**
   Navigate to the Docker Compose directory and run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

This setup will work but may not guarantee the same performance or reliability as the AWS-based deployment.
