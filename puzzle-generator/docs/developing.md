# Project Setup
This guide will walk you through setting up and running the Time lock puzzle project in Python.

## Prerequisites
 - Python 3.7+: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
 - GMPY2: This library is required for high-performance modular arithmetic. It provides bindings to the GMP library for Python.

## Setting Up a Virtual Environment
Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for this project.
1. Create the Virtual Environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
2. Activate the Virtual Environment:
 - On macOS and Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
 - On Windows:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Install Dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Ensure that gmpy2 is installed. If you encounter issues, you may need to install GMP and MPFR on your system (e.g., sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev on Ubuntu).
```bash
sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev
```

## Initializing database
```bash
python src/database/initialize_db.py
```


## Running the Project
To generate a VDF proof and verify it, run the main.py script:
```bash
python main.py 10
```
Required Command line Arguments:
 - count: the number of time lock puzzles to generate and store in the database

## Running the Tests
To run the unit tests, use the following command:
```bash
pytest
```
With coverage:
```bash
pytest --cov=src
```
